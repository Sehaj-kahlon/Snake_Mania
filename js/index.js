// can use setInterval feature of JS for this like it will perform the funciton repeatedly
// but when you are rendering animation -- it is highly recommended to use the bellow function ðŸ˜œ
// this function takes a function as an argument

// main function - it takes time stamp current time as an argument
// we called the requestAnimationFrame inside the main function this will call the main function again and again so now it is a game loop
